## Hexonacci Calculator

A simple Hexonacci calculator.

Will print out the nth hexonacci number.

This is just a little thing I threw together while getting started with Rust.


## How to run

#### Debug

```sh
cargo run -- 100
```

#### Release

```sh
cargo run --release -- 100
```

```sh
cargo build --release && ./target/release/hex 100
```

Pass in whatever number you want instead of 100.


#### Test

```sh
cargo Test
```
